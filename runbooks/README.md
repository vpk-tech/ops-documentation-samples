# Runbook Samples

This folder contains different types of operational runbooks used by small teams.

## System-Level Runbooks
These runbooks focus on system availability and infrastructure-level issues.
Example:
- Application or system not accessible
- Service failures
- VM or network-related issues

## Task-Level Runbooks
These runbooks focus on repeatable operational tasks and user issues.
Example:
- Password resets
- Account unlocks
- Access-related troubleshooting

All runbooks follow a clear, step-by-step format designed to reduce dependency on a single person.
