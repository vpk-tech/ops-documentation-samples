# Ops Documentation & Runbook Samples for Startups

## Who this is for
This is for early-stage startups who do not have a dedicated DevOps/IT person.

## The problem
When documentation is missing, downtime increases and customer trust erodes.

## What I provide
I focus on creating simple, practical documentation based on real operational issues that small teams commonly face.

## Example incident scenario
+ A production issue occurred when an application hosted on an Azure Virtual Machine became unavailable after a restart.
+ The team struggled because only one person understood the VM setup and related services.
+ There was no documentation explaining VM configuration, application services, or dependency on Azure networking and storage.
+ As a result, recovery took hours instead of minutes.
+ **With a clear Azure runbook**, the team could have checked VM status, validated services, and restored access quickly.
