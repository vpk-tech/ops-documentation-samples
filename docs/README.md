# Documentation Samples

This folder contains example documentation used to explain system context and setup.

Typical documents include:
- System overviews
- Access and environment explanations
- Setup and configuration notes

These documents support operational runbooks and help teams understand systems without relying on a single individual.

These documents are intended for understanding system context, not for incident resolution.
